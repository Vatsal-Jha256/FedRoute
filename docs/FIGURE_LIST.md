## List of Figures

### Figure 1: Training Convergence Comparison
**File**: `results/figures/figure1_convergence.pdf`

**Description**: Comparison of training convergence across different federated learning methods over 50 communication rounds. The figure shows median accuracy with 25th and 75th percentile bands for FedRoute-FMTL (our method), FedAvg baseline, and Independent-FL baseline, compared against a centralized upper bound.

**Key Findings**:
- FedRoute-FMTL achieves 75% final combined accuracy
- Outperforms FedAvg by 11% and Independent-FL by 22%
- Converges within 30 rounds, demonstrating efficient learning
- Shaded quartile regions show consistent performance across runs

**Placement**: Section 5.1 (Convergence Analysis)

### Figure 2: Privacy-Utility Tradeoff
**File**: `results/figures/figure2_privacy_utility.pdf`

**Description**: Analysis of the tradeoff between privacy budget (epsilon) and recommendation accuracy. Three curves show path recommendation, music recommendation, and combined accuracy across privacy budget values from ε=0.1 (high privacy) to ε=10.0 (low privacy).

**Key Findings**:
- At ε=1.0 (standard privacy), achieves 69.9% combined accuracy
- Music recommendations slightly more robust to privacy noise than path recommendations
- Diminishing returns beyond ε=5.0
- Highlights three privacy regions: high (ε<1), medium (1≤ε<5), low (ε≥5)

**Placement**: Section 5.2 (Privacy-Utility Analysis)

### Figure 3: Method Comparison
**File**: `results/figures/figure3_comparison.pdf`

**Description**: Bar chart comparing final performance (at round 50) across four methods: FedRoute-FMTL, FedAvg, Independent-FL, and Random Selection. Shows path accuracy, music accuracy, and combined accuracy for each method.

**Key Findings**:
- FedRoute-FMTL: 75% combined (72% path, 78% music)
- FedAvg: 64% combined (61% path, 67% music)
- Independent-FL: 53% combined (51% path, 55% music)
- Random Selection: 43.5% combined (42% path, 45% music)
- Clear advantage of multi-task learning and advanced client selection

**Placement**: Section 5.3 (Baseline Comparison)

### Figure 4: Ablation Study
**File**: `results/figures/figure4_ablation.pdf`

**Description**: Ablation study demonstrating the impact of individual components. Five configurations: Full FedRoute, No Multi-Task Learning, No Advanced Selection, No Privacy, and Minimal (no MTL, no selection).

**Key Findings**:
- Multi-task learning contributes 17% accuracy improvement
- Advanced client selection adds 13% improvement
- Privacy mechanisms reduce accuracy by 4% (acceptable tradeoff)
- Full system achieves 75% vs 52% for minimal configuration

**Placement**: Section 5.4 (Ablation Study)

### Figure 5: Scalability Analysis
**File**: `results/figures/figure5_scalability.pdf`

**Description**: Two-panel figure showing scalability with respect to number of clients. Left panel shows final accuracy vs. number of clients (10-500). Right panel shows average time per communication round vs. number of clients.

**Key Findings**:
- Accuracy improves logarithmically with more clients (68% at 10 clients, 77% at 500)
- Time complexity near-linear: 2.5s for 10 clients, 5.4s for 500 clients
- System maintains efficiency even at 500 clients
- Demonstrates practical scalability for real-world IoV deployment

**Placement**: Section 5.5 (Scalability Evaluation)

## Flowcharts (TikZ)

### Flowchart 1: System Architecture
**File**: `docs/tikz_flowcharts.tex` (lines 9-77)

**Description**: System-level architecture showing data flow from vehicle trajectories, music data, and POI database through client vehicles, federated server, and FMTL model components.

**Components Shown**:
- Data sources (trajectories, music, POIs)
- Client-side processing (context extraction, local training)
- Server-side components (client selection, secure aggregation, DP)
- Model architecture (shared encoder, task-specific heads)

**Placement**: Section 3 (System Architecture)

### Flowchart 2: Federated Learning Process
**File**: `docs/tikz_flowcharts.tex` (lines 82-158)

**Description**: Detailed flowchart of the federated learning training process, from initialization through convergence. Shows the complete training loop including client selection, local training, gradient clipping, and secure aggregation.

**Key Steps**:
1. Initialize global model
2. Multi-objective client selection
3. Broadcast model to selected clients
4. Local training (K epochs)
5. Gradient clipping (DP mechanism)
6. Upload updates
7. Secure aggregation with DP noise
8. Update global model
9. Check convergence

**Placement**: Section 4 (Training Algorithm)
