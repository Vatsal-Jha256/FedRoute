# FedRoute Framework: Technical Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

This technical report documents the implementation and initial evaluation of the FedRoute framework, a Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) system designed for privacy-preserving dual recommendations in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem. The framework successfully integrates path and music recommendation tasks within a unified federated learning architecture while maintaining strong privacy guarantees through Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation mechanisms.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) represents a rapidly growing ecosystem of connected vehicles that generate vast amounts of data while requiring real-time, personalized services. Traditional centralized approaches to recommendation systems in this domain face significant challenges:

- **Privacy Concerns**: Strict regulations (GDPR, CCPA) limit data collection and sharing
- **Scalability Issues**: Centralized systems struggle with millions of vehicles
- **Cross-modal Learning**: Single-task systems miss opportunities for knowledge transfer
- **Real-time Requirements**: Low-latency needs for safety-critical applications

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current IoV recommendation systems either compromise user privacy through centralized data collection or miss opportunities for cross-modal learning between different recommendation tasks. There is a critical need for a privacy-preserving framework that can simultaneously learn multiple recommendation tasks while respecting user privacy and system constraints.

### 1.3 Proposed Solution

FedRoute addresses these challenges through a novel Federated Multi-Task Learning framework that:

1. **Unifies Learning**: Combines path and music recommendations in a single model
2. **Preserves Privacy**: Uses Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation
3. **Optimizes for IoV**: Handles high-mobility, heterogeneous environments
4. **Enables Knowledge Transfer**: Shared representations improve both tasks

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overall Design

The FedRoute framework follows a client-server architecture optimized for federated learning in IoV environments:
