# FedRoute: Federated Multi-Task Learning for IoV Recommendations

## Project Overview

FedRoute is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework designed for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem. It provides dual-recommendation capabilities for both intelligent path planning and contextual music recommendations while maintaining user privacy through federated learning techniques.

## Key Features

- **Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL)**: Unified architecture for path and music recommendations
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Differential Privacy and Secure Aggregation
- **IoV-Optimized**: Designed for high-mobility, heterogeneous vehicle environments
- **Multi-Objective Client Selection**: Advanced participant selection algorithm
- **Real-world Simulation**: SUMO integration for realistic traffic scenarios
